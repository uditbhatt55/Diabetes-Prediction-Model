project:
  title: "Diabetes Prediction Model"
  description: >
    A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes
    based on medical and demographic factors such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure,
    insulin, and age. The project is trained using ensemble learning (XGBoost + LightGBM)
    and deployed as a Streamlit web application for real-time user interaction.
